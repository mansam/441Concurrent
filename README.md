Concurrent Java Project: Centipede
----------------------------------

A multithreaded Centipede game. (Concurrent software systems class project.)

User Manual
-----------

In the game of centipede, the objective is to survive a centipede attack. The player can move
using either the mouse or the arrow keys. They can also fire bullets towards the oncoming
centipede with the space bar or clicking the left mouse button. Unfortunately, the field is
littered with mushrooms which obstruct the line of fire. When a centipede is shot, one segment
of the centipede disappears and creates a mushroom where it stood. The centipede then splits
into two centipedes, which each travel along a different path.

The Basics
----------

* Move with either left/right arrows or with the mouse
* Fire with either the space bar or the left mouse button
